# EduForum – College-Exclusive Discussion and Collaboration Platform

**EduForum** is a mobile-first academic communication platform built specifically for students and faculty within a verified college ecosystem. Designed as a blend of LinkedIn’s professional networking and WhatsApp’s conversational ease, EduForum enables structured discussions, peer engagement, and academic collaboration in a secure, role-based environment.

Only verified members of a college (students or faculty) can access EduForum using their institutional credentials. The platform is tailored for Indian colleges and universities, offering an easy-to-use Android application backed by Firebase and Java.
